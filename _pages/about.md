Hi.. Hola.. Servus.. Bonjour.. and Namaste..

I am a PhD student at the Compuatational Lingustics and Natural Language processing (NLP) group at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Prof Timothy Baldwin and Dr. Jey Han Lau. I am currently working on understanding the different stylistics aspects in a language and style transfer in text using Deep Learning architectures. Additionally from time to time, I also work with different models around Topic Models. Previously, during my masters at the University of Melbourne I worked with Evaluation and Labelling of Topic Models.


Other than working with NLP and Deep Learning, I am really passionate about the health of our planet, climate change, sustainability, recycling and reducing the use of plastic and cleaning up our oceans. It is high time we as people start playing our part both at an individual level and also collectively to make governments take constructive steps towards combating climate change.


My CV can be found [here](/al-folio/assets/pdf/CV.pdf){:target="\_blank"} and some of important publications on [publications page](/al-folio/publications/)


I am always open to new ideas, debates, opinions and queries. Feel free to get in touch.

My email address is my first name followed by my last name at gmail.com (all lowercase).
